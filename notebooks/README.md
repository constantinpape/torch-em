# Jupyter Notebooks for `torch-em`-based Implementations and Tutorials

1. `tutorial_create_dataloaders.ipynb`: This notebook gives you a head-start on how to create your custom dataloaders for segmentation for most data structures. It's recommended to checkout https://github.com/constantinpape/torch-em/blob/main/doc/datasets_and_dataloaders.md for the first outlook before getting started.

2. `prediction_tiling_window.ipynb`: This notebook gives you an overview of tiling-window-based prediction from trained models.
